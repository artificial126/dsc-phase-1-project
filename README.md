# IMDB Movies Analyze

   This project prepared to analyze imdb movie datasets and give recommendation to new studio to make movie.


## Business Problem

   Microsoft have decided to create a new movie studio, but they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. In this project you can see 9 different visualizations to easily see what my analyzes are. 

## The Data

   There are 11 different datasets in this project. You can see dataframes at section '2' in student.ipynb.


## Getting Started

* My approach to the this problem is looking thru studios at section 3.1, movie types at section 3.2, movie budgets at section 3.3, directors at section 3.4.

* I used 'bom.movie_gross.csv.gz' dataset for looking inside studios. Grouped and created first graph to look top 20 studios with most revenue.

* At the section 3.2 merged 'mdb.title.basics.csv.gz' and 'bom.movie_gross.csv.gz' to looked most made movie types. Also some process of coding to look top 3 studios made movie types.

* Section 3.3 for budget revenue relations(which analyzed positive relation).

* Finally section 3.4 for directors to look at the visualization the highest-gross directors.

## Result

   Conclusion is at the last section of my 'student.ipynb'.
